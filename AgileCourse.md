I. The Agile manifesto
----------------------
Individuals and iteractions		over	Processes and tools
Working software				over 	Comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration 			over 	Contract negociation
Responding to Change			over 	Following a Plan

	a. Individuals and iteractions
		People
		Processes and tools should help team work instead of replacing them.

	b. Working Software
		Value
		From costumer perspective a working software is more valuable that comprehensive documentation.
		Agile produce only the necesary documentation

	c. Customer collaboration
		Flexibility
		We shouyld recognize since the very start that things are going to change.
		Agile provides moreflexible contrat models

	d. Responding to change
		Smart planning
		Adapting our plan to the changes


II. Agile principles
---------------------
	1. Highest priority : sastify the costumer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software

	2. Welcome changing requirements. Agile processes harness change for the costumer's competitive advantage.
	
	3. Deliver working software frequently (weekly or monthly) prefering the shorter timescale.
	
	4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
	
	5. Build projects around motivated individuals.Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
	
	6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within the team is face-to-face conversation.
	
	7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
	
	8. Agile processes promote sustainable development.
	Sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace 
	indefinitly
	
	9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
	
	10. Simplicity -the art of maximizing the amount of work not done- is essential.
	
	11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
	
	12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

III. The Whole team approach
-----------------------------

 Agile teams are:
 	a. Number
  		- small (7 +/- 2)
  		- stable
  		- Cross functional
  		- Includes a "customer"
  		- Larger groups should be splitted into multiple sub-teams
  		- Building healthier and stronger teams
  		- Improving team bonding and synergy
  		- Co-location (all the team in the same place)
  		- All meetings are attended by everyone
  	
  	b. Skills
		- Possesses all the skills needed
  		- Generalizing specialists
  		- People who can act more than one role are preferred
  		- The team collectively have the necessary skills
  		- Any task might be completed by any team member
  		- Constant collaboration
		- Agile is all about Quality

	c. Purpose
		- Maximizes the business value
		- The whole team is responsible for quality
		- Knowledge transfer
		- The whole team is involved in any meetings regarding product features
		- Transparency.

	d. Accountability
		- Shared ownership.
		- No "departments".
		- Team takes responsability for all kinds of testing tasks.
	
	e. Benefits
		- Enhancing communication and collaboration within the team.
		- Helps team to build a strong working relationships, through effective coloperation, teamwork and communication.
		- Enabling the various skill sets within the team to maximize the value of the project.
		- Helps team members to learn and share knowledge with each other.
		- Making quality everyone's responsability.
		- Making everyone cillectively responsible for the outcome.


IV. Early and frequent feedback
--------------------------------
 - Avoids requirements misunderstandings.
 - Catch defects early in the development cycle.
 - Clarifying customer feature requests.
 - Providing information to the agile team.
 - Promoting consistent project momentun.
 - Understand our strengths, weaknesses and our gaps better.

 V. Aspect of agile Approaches
 --------------------------------
 	a. Extreme programming (XP)
 	*****************************
 	Considered to be the most complete agile process model
 	5 values:
 		- Simplicity
 		- Communication
 		- Feedback
 		- Courage
 		- Respect

 	13 Practices:
 		- Sit together
 		The whole team should work in the same room

 		- Whole team
 		The team should represent all qualifications

 		- Informative workspace
 		All important information about the project should be available within the workspace

 		- Energized work
 		All members are motivated and work energetically at any time
 		No extended and streched overtime

 		- Pair programming
 		All programation code is written by 2 devellopers
 		1 driver, 1 observer

 		- Stories
 		All requirements are sated in the form of a story

 		- Weekly cycle
 		1 iteration. 1 iteration = 1 or more stories

 		- Quarterly cycle
 		1 release = quarterly

 		- Slack (Slacktime)
 		Free available time used for a non project work (e.g.: Training)

 		- Ten-minute build
 		Building the system and running the system level function test must not take more than 10min (tought to implement)

 		- Continuous integration
 		Have the build fully functionnal most of the time

 		- Test first programming
 		Before some programm code is written, an automated test of this code is written first. The automated test should succeed for this element considered to be finish.

 		- Incremental design
 		Design completed step by step, along with the code.

 	b. Scrum
 	*********
 	Another Agile process.

 		- Roles:
 			º Scrum master (Coach): ensures that scrums pratice and rules are understood, implemented and followed. Resolves any violation, resource issues or other impediments.

 			º Product Owner: Represents the customer. Maximizes the value of the product. Manages product backlog, prioritization, accuracy, shared understanding, value and visibility.

 			º Development team : fulfill all the roles needed to complete the work. Develop and test.

 		- Sprints :
 			º The project is divided into iterations called sprints.

 			º Every iteration should build a potentially shippable prduct increment.
 			
 			º the team decides the sprint's time duration and how long it lasts.
 			
 			º Once decided, the sprint duration should not be modified
 			
 			º A sprint is a "mini project", no changes a made that can modify the sprint's goal
 			
 			º Each sprint includes a sprint planning meeting, daily scrums, development work, a sprint review and the sprint retrospective.

 			º The development team members are kept the same throughout the sprint.

 		- Product increment:
 			Each sprint results with a potentially realisable shipable product called an increment.

 		- Product Backlog:
 			º list of product items managed by the product owner.
 			
 			º It's the oredered list of everything needed for the product.
 			
 			º The product backlog is the single source for requirements
 			
 			º It's dynamic and evolves as the product evolves from 
 			sprint to sprint (Backlog refinement).
 			
 			º Contains features to be built, functions requirements, nonfunctional requirements, enhancements, and fixes.
 			
 			º Each item has a value to the users or customers of the product.

 			º It's prioritizad by the product owner and requisitioned at the start of each iteration.

 			º Grooming : Adding more details, and order to the backlog.

 		- Sprint Backlog:
 			º The team selects a set of priority items from the product baclog and put it to the sprint backlog with a plan of how to achieve the sprint goal.

 			º Pull principle: The devellopers pull the items from the product backlog. It's not the product owner that pushes theses items.

 			º The sprint backlog may only be updated by the development team.

 		- Definition of done:
 			º The team defines what done means regarding the items before to begin to work on them.

 		- Timeboxes:
 			º Timeboxes are short, fixed-duration periods of time in which activities or work are undertaken.

 			º Move the uncompleted work into another timebox.

 			º Other examples of timeboxes includes: daily stand-up or iterations

 		- Transparency:
 			º Content and progress of the current sprint, including test results, visible to the team, management, and all interested parties.

 	Scrum doesn't dictate a specific software developing technique.
 	Scrum doesn't provides how testing has to be done.



 	c. Kanban
 	**********
 	Kan = visual
 	ban = billboard

 	The purpose of kanban is to visualize and optimize the flow of work within a value-added chain.
 	Chain : coding - testing -accepting deploying...

 	We try to optimize the flow of work within a chain, this is done by limiting work in progress (WIP) to help identify issues and minimize the waste and cost associated with changes during development.

 	Kanban uses 3 instruments:
 		º Kanban board:
 			- Visualizes the value chain
 			
 			- Each columns shows a station (set of activities) Items to be produced or tasks to be processed are symbolized by tickets moving left to right through the stations.

 			- Columns are:
 			Backloh | Selected | Develop (on going / Done) | Deploy | Live
 		
 		º W.I.P. limit
 			- A low amount of WIP increases the visibility of issues and facilitates continuous improvement.
 			
 			- This is controlled by the maximum number of tickets allowed for a station and/or globally for the board
 			
 			- Whenever a column as free capacity a ticket is pulled form a predecessor station.

 		º Lead time:
 			- Kanban optimize the continuous flow of tasks by minimizing the lead time for the complete value stream

 	Like in Scrums, Kanban vizualize the active tasks.
 	Tasks not yet activated are waiting into the backlog.
 	Kanban process allows releasing its deliverables item by item.


 	d. Collaborative user story creation
 	*************************************
 	Each requirements should ahave a value to the user: that's why it's call "user story".

 	User stories are written with the following format:
 		As <Role>
 		I want <Functionality>
 		So that <Business Benefit>

 	- The product owner explains the User Story to the team.
 	- Shared vision of a feature is obtained through frequent informal reviews, conversations and discussions.
 	- The user story adresses functional and non-functional characteristics
 	- Each story includes acceptance criterias that will determine when the task is finished
 	- Tester's perspective improves User Story identifying missing details or non-functional requirements


 		º Effective User Stories technique : INVEST
 			I: Independent
 				being able to reprioritize and develop user stories in any order
 			N: Negotiable
 				making tradeoff's based on cost and function with business representatives
 			V: Valuable
 				(indispensable)
 			E: Estimatable
 				We should be able to estimate the effortr of the user story
 			S: Small
 				easier to estimate and test (1/2 - 10 days)
 			T: Testable

 		º 3 Cs concept:
 			1. Card: 			where the requirements are written down
 			2. Conversation: 	collaborating to define the requirements and understand the value
 			3. Confirmation:	Agreeing on the acceptance criteria to know when we're done

 	e. Retrospectives:
 	******************
 	QA activity : What was succesful, what can be improved,...

 	- It covers topics such as process, people, organizations, relationship, and tools.
 	- The lessons and improvements are applicable to the upcoming work.
 	- Improves the global work of the team.
 	- The team should implement only a few improvements per iteration, allowing a continuous improvement at a sustained pace.

 	Benefits and improvements:
 		. Improved Productivity
 		. Improved Capability
 		. Improved Quality
 		. Improved Capacity

 	The retrospective meeting is conducted right after the sprint review.
 	Retrospectives need MUTUAL TRUST.
 	3 questions to ask:
 		- What should we start doing?
 		- What should we stop doing?
 		- What should we continue to do?

 	f. Continuous Integration:
 	**************************
 	Helps minimizing the integration problems.
 	Help deliver reliable, working, integrated software.

 		º Continuous Integration Process:
 			. Static code analysis
 			. Compiling
 			. Unit test
 			. Deploy
 			. Integration Test
 			. Report
 		The process is fully automated

 		º Continuous Integration Components:
 			. Source code control system
 			. Build tool
 			. Test tools
 			. Scheduler or trigger (initiate the integration process)
 			. Notification

 	Automated build and test process takes place on a daily basis and detects integration errors early and quickly.

 	Continuous Integration allows Agile Testers to run automated test regularly

 	Test results are visible to all team members.

 	Build tools are used to implement continuous quality control :
 		- sstatic and dynamic tests
 		- Measure and profile performance
 		- Extract and format documentatiom from the source code
 		- Facilitate manual quality assurance processes

 	Continuous Integration Risks:
 		- Ttools have to be introduced and maintained.
 		- CI process must be defined and establish.
 		- Tast automation requires additional resources.
 		- Thorough test coverage is essential to achieve automated testing advantages.
 		- Over relying on unit test and not performing enough system and acceptance test
 		- Setup time to establish a build server and configure the continuous integration software
 		- cost of procuring the server machine
 		- time required to build a suite of automated tests

 	g. Velocity:
 	************
 	It's the measure of a team's capacity for work per iteration.
 	It's based on the number of User Stories completed on past iterations.

 	Can be used to determine when a project will be completed.
 	Velocity usually varies most in the first few iterations and then begins to stabilize.

 	h. Release Planning:
 	********************
 	>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Project>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 	>>>Release Plan>>> >>>Release Plan>>>
 	>>Iter>>  >>Iter>>  >>Iter>> >>Iter>>

	- Agile projects are divided into releases and iterations
	- A release is a group of iterarions that results in the completion of a valuable deliverable.

	Test planning activities includes:
	 - Scope of testing, extent of testing for those areas in scope, test goals, reasons for it.
	 - Who will carry the test activities
	 - Test environment, test data needed, when they are needed.
	 - Timing, sequencing, prerequesites.
	 - Project and quality risks to be adressed
	 - Estimation of time and effort needed for the testing activities.

	. Release planning looks ahead to the release of a product, and defines and redefines the product backlog.
	. When planning we ask: "What proportion of the user wtory baclog can be delivered in the release?"
	. After Release planning is done, iteration planning of the first iteration starts.

		 Iteration Planning:
		 .....................
	
			. We ask the team to selectt high priority use stories to developed, tested and delivered within the iteration.
			. The team elaborates User Story, performs risk analysis andestimate the work needed.
			. Once the contents of the iteration are finalized, the user stories are broken into tasks, carried out by the appropriate team members.

				Iteration Planning activities:
	 			  	- Detailed risk analisys of user stories.
					- Determine the testability of user stories.
					- Create acceptance tests for the user stories.
					- Breaking down user stories into tasks (in particular testing tasks).
					- Estimating testing effort for all testing tasks.
					- Identifying functional and non-functional aspects to be tested
					- Supporting and sparticipating in test automation

	Release Planning changes:
	 - Internal factor (delivery capabilities, velocity, internal issues)
	 - External factors (new market & opportunities, new competitors, business threats)
	 - iteration plan may change during an iteration.
